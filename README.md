### Freelance Programmer
#### Skills: C++ / VB6 / GODOT / NETWORKING
I've been programming for a few years in a mix of VB6 and C++.

I have strong experience with networking, turn-based battle systems and tile-based games.

I can design and implement various systems and write technical design documents.

#### Projects
